Vulnerability Information
Asset Inventory: True

Description
The remote service accepts connections encrypted using TLS 1.1. TLS 1.1 lacks support for current and recommended cipher suites. Ciphers that support encryption before MAC computation, and authenticated encryption modes such as GCM cannot be used with TLS 1.1

As of March 31, 2020, Endpoints that are not enabled for TLS 1.2 and higher will no longer function properly with major web browsers and major vendors.
Solution
Enable support for TLS 1.2 and/or 1.3, and disable support for TLS 1.1.
